# LoRaWan-for-Agricultural-Sensors-Image-Transmission
Jetson Code can be found in main. Currently, UART is seperate from main, but can easily be implemented into main by deleting the hex_strings variable in the uart_test file and pasting uart_test into main. main also includes an algorithm which can reconstruct the image from the Hex Strings. This algorithm is to be used on the receiving end of the wireless stransmission, after all strings have been transmitted.
